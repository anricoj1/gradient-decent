CSC 481 Homework 2
    - Using batch and stochastic gradient descent
    - Determining new weights and best fit line

finding y at:
    - x = 5
    - x = -100
    - x = 100

batch.py == batch gradient descent
stoch.py == stochastic gradient descent

Im assuming you have pylab installed:
    - I run my .py files in terminal (python batch.py and python stoch.py)
    - It should work exactly the same in the IDE as well
