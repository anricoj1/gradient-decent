# CSC 481 Homework 2
    - Using batch and stochastic gradient descent
    - Determining new weights and best fit line

# To Run
  - Method 1:
    - new run.sh file
    - make sure you (chmod u+x run.sh)
    - if not just "sh run.sh" in terminal
  - Method 2:
    - Stochastic Gradient Descent
      - python3 stoch.py
    - Batch Gradient Descent
      - python3 batch.py


# What I Learned
  - How to Interpret Gradient Descent
  - Using Batch Does Take Longer (of course)
  - Stochastic is much faster and much more optimal with large data sets


# Results
finding y at:
    - x = 5
    - x = -100
    - x = 100

batch.py == batch gradient descent
stoch.py == stochastic gradient descent

Im assuming you have pylab installed:
    - I run my .py files in terminal (python batch.py and python stoch.py)
    - It should work exactly the same in the IDE as well
